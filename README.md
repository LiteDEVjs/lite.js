There are 2 commands that are used in this project:

1. The first is a development command, by default it opens the site page on your browser. If you see the welcome window, congratulations, you are now ready to develop your application!

```bash
gulp
```

2. The second is a command for building a project for production. This command minifies all source code, compresses images and creates a dist folder in the root of the project. 

```bash
gulp build
```
